# `oxpilot` - AI copilot, in Rust

`oxpilot` is a copilot server powered by LLM (large language models) written in Rust. It's built on top of [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle), with aims to be minimalist, fast, and accessable (in terms of computing resource) copilot for everyone.

## Goal of this project

The primary goal of this project is to teach (myself, and everyone else) idiomatic Rust, similar to [mini-redis](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mini-redis), thefore the code is overly heavily documented, there is an article introducing the core concepts [I made a Copilot in Rust ðŸ¦€ , here is what I have learned... ](), I recommand to read first, and [PRs description](https://github.com/chenhunghan/oxpilot/pulls?q=is%3Apr) are heavily documented with design patterns used in the code base.
