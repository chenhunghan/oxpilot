# `oxpilot` - rusty AI copilot

`oxpilot` is a CLI powered by LLM[^1] written in Rust ðŸ¦€. It's built on top of [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle), with aims to be minimalist, fast, and accessible (in terms of computing resource).

## Install

### Mac

Install using `brew`

```sh
brew install chenhunghan/homebrew-formulae/oxpilot
```

Upgrade to the latest

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade oxpilot
```

### Linux and Windows

Go to [releases](https://github.com/chenhunghan/oxpilot/releases) for binaries.

## Commands

### Chat

Who doesn't want to chat with AI?

```sh
ox hi in Japanese
```

### **_AI_** Commmit with LLM

I am very lazy at drafting a comprehensive commit message, why not make LLM genereate one for me according to `git diff`? Don't worry, `ox` will ask your confirmation before commit the changes/messages.

```sh
git add .
ox commit # proxy to `git commit` with generated message
```

![ox](https://github.com/chenhunghan/oxpilot/assets/1474479/18848999-06fd-4778-8273-5ad458d1ff6b)

It will try to generate a commit message following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec, however, LLM isn't perfect and you can always edit before commit.

Fun fact: most of commits in this repo are generated by `ox` itself.

### Start the copilot server

Start a Github copilot-compatible server, see the [this](https://dev.to/chenhunghan/use-code-llama-and-other-open-llms-as-drop-in-replacement-for-copilot-code-completion-58hg) on how to configure the Copilot extensions in your editor to pointing to the copilot-compatible server.

```sh
ox serve
```

## Goal of this project

The primary goal of this project is to teach (myself, and everyone else) idiomatic Rust, similar to [mini-redis](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mini-redis), therefore the code is overly heavily documented, there is an article introducing the core concepts [I made a Copilot in Rust ðŸ¦€ , here is what I have learned](https://dev.to/chenhunghan/i-made-a-copilot-in-rust-here-is-what-i-have-learned-as-a-typescript-dev-52md), I recommend to read first, and [PRs description](https://github.com/chenhunghan/oxpilot/pulls?q=is%3Apr) are packed with design patterns used in the code base.
